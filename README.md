This book will teach you how to build a skinned animation system for video games. The book takes a step by step approach starting with the basics of how to open a Win32 OpenGL window, working trough the required math, until you finally build a feature compleate animation system. Several advanced topics are covered as well.

**Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6** cover the basics, everything you need to know before implementing an animation system. This means Opening a Win32 OpenGL window, math and building an OpenGL abstraction layer.

**Chapter 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10** will teach you how to load skinned models from GLTF files, and how to animate them. By the end of Chapter 10, you will have built a feature complete skeletal animation system.

**Chapter 11** is focused only on optimizing the animation system. Several optimiations are covered, as well as when it makes sense to use them.

**Chapters 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16** all cover advanced animation concepts. Here you will learn some advanced techniques like animation blending inverse kinematics, dual quaternion skinning and crowd rendering.
